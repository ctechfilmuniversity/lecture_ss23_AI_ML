# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

**Syllabus**

This seminar aims to give students a background in the history of AI research and an overview of current debates concerning the role of AI in society and its current implementations (e.g. Generative Modelling, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Text-to-Image Generation) in contemporary creative practices. In addition, participants will gain an overview of the current tools available to build machine learning models.

*Future iterations*: Will include a series of “tech demos” of various AI applications, programming environments and plugins (e.g. various generative neural networks, tools such as AirSim and DeepDrive, RunwayML) Participants will build a simple neural network (probably a GAN) in Google Colab using Tensor Flow with a given dataset. Guest lecture on AI ethics?

**Learning objectives**

At the end of this workshop, students will be able to:

- Give an account of the broad history of AI research since the 19th century, as well as the current state-of-the-art in data-driven AI/ML approaches.
- Articulate different positions and critiques of the role of AI in art and society (and back them up with examples and case studies).
- Begin a process of experimentation with different AI/ML tools, including both interface-based (e.g. Runway ML, Dall-e, Midjourney, ChatGPT) and programming tools (e.g. Google Colab)
- Develop their own reading lists and avenues for further personal research on the subject of AI and its implications.

**Time and place**

Friday 7th July 2023

10 am - 5 pm

Room 6119 (Haus 6)

**Method of instruction**

- This is a one-day workshop and there is no associated homework.
- Instruction will take the form of a lecture + discussion-based activities.
- There may also be a practical part of the workshop involving use of already-existing ML interfaces (tbd).

**Materials**

A reading list with further materials is available here: https://www.are.na/alex-walmsley/ai-reading-list

This is my personal AI reading list and is semi-frequently updated when I find something relevant/interesting. Students not expected to have read everything here by any means but they are certainly encouraged to build their own reading lists (using [are.na](http://are.na) or any other tool they like)!
